The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been profound, resulting in significant loss of life and widespread disruption. The selection of this dataset was motivated by the desire to meticulously examine and analyze the data, particularly focusing on countries with the highest mortality rates among infected individuals. Additionally, the objective is to ascertain the percentage of population affected by the virus and the corresponding vaccination coverage aimed at combatting its spread. This formal approach aims to glean valuable insights into the pandemic's effects and the effectiveness of mitigation efforts on a global scale.

1. Total Cases: What is the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases recorded in the dataset?
2. Regional Distribution: What is the distribution of COVID-19 cases across different regions or countries? Which regions have been most affected by the pandemic?
3. Total Deaths: What is the the total number of COVID-19 deaths recorded in the dataset?
4. Vaccination Progress Over Time: Track the progress of COVID-19 vaccination efforts by analyzing vaccination rates over time.
5. Hospitalized Patients: which Countries have Highest Hospitalized Patients
